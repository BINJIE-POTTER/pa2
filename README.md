@mainpage ELEC 331 Programming Assignment 2

@author Kaiwen Deng  Xinyue Ma  Binjie Ye

Our program works by first co,piling the C++ code and run it through the command line. 
You can first call g++ -std=c++11 lsr.cpp -o lsr and g++ -std=c++11 lsr.cpp -o dvr to
compike the link state routing and distance vector routing and then use 
./lsr <topologyFile> <messageFile> <changesFile> and ./dvr <topologyFile> <messageFile> <changesFile> 
to execute the file. 

The project is relatively easier than the first assignment probably due to the variety of
languages we can choose this time. We like the project and think this is a interesting project.
